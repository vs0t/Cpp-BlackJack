# CPP Blackjack Game

## Description

CPP Blackjack is a console-based simulation of the classic Blackjack card game. It allows users to simulate multiple players in a game, each trying to achieve the best possible hand without exceeding a score of 21. This project was developed as part of an exam submission, showcasing object-oriented programming principles and the use of C++ for game development.

## Features

- Simulate multiple players in a game.
- Automatic calculation of hand values, including handling of Aces as 1 or 11.
- Automatic decision-making for drawing additional cards.
- Evaluation of player scores to determine winners, ties, and busts.
- Manual inclusion of GoogleTest in the build directory due to linking issues.

## Installation

To compile and run the project, you will need `g++`, `cmake`, and `googletest` installed. Note that GoogleTest was manually downloaded and included in the `build/_deps` directory due to issues with linking. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project.
3. Create a build directory: `mkdir build`
4. Run CMake to configure the project: `cmake -S . -B build`
5. Compile the project: `cmake --build build`

The compiled binaries will be located in the `build/app` and `build/tests` directories.

## Usage

To run the game simulation, execute the following command from the terminal:

```bash
./build/app/blackjack
```

To run the unit tests, execute:

```bash
./build/tests/blackjacktests
```
